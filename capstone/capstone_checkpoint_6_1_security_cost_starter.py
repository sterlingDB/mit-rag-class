# # Capstone Checkpoint 6.1 — Securing and Cost-Optimizing an Agent-Based RAG System
# **MO-LLM Module 6 / Required Capstone Checkpoint (120 minutes)**
#
# ## What this checkpoint is
#
# This is the operational hardening step of your capstone. You take the agent-based RAG
# system you built in Checkpoint 5.1 and ask the two questions Module 6 raises about any
# deployed system: **is it secure, and is it affordable?** An agent that decides what to
# retrieve and which tool to use has a larger attack surface than a fixed pipeline, and its
# multi-step loop spends more tokens. This applies the Module 6 labs (Lab 6.1's security
# probes and Lab 6.2's token-cost measurement) to your capstone scenario.
#
# The graded deliverable is a **written submission** (final section); this script is a
# runnable demonstration — a tiny agent loop, per-role token accounting, and two
# prompt-injection probes — so you can see the security and cost behaviour before adapting
# it to your full system.
#
# **Learning outcomes (Module 6):**
# 1. Identify the attack surfaces of an agent-based RAG system (command/prompt injection,
#    context poisoning, tool misuse).
# 2. Apply mitigations that keep retrieved text as data — not instructions — and constrain
#    the agent's tools.
# 3. Measure token cost across the planner and answer LLM calls, and reduce it.
# 4. Evaluate the security and cost trade-offs of model selection (a weak→strong ladder;
#    a mixed planner/answer model split).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Step 1 — Keep your capstone scenario
#
# Use the **same scenario** you chose in Checkpoint 1.1 and have built on since. Module 6
# adds a security-and-cost lens to the agent you already have.
#
# | Scenario | Corpus | Security and Performance Audit to address |
# |---|---|---|
# | **Research Paper Navigator** | ~150 research-paper PDFs | command/roleplay injection in the user turn; poisoned text inside a retrieved PDF treated as instructions; token cost of multi-step search; a cheaper planner vs. answer model |
# | **Wikipedia Retrieval Engine** | ~2,400 Wikipedia HTML articles | injection via crafted article text; context poisoning from pasted "sources"; token cost per query at scale; the model-ladder cost/robustness trade-off |
#
# An agent shines when one query isn't enough — but the same autonomy that lets it search,
# look, and search again is what an attacker tries to hijack, and every extra step costs
# tokens.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setup (~5 min)
#
# 1. **Python 3.11 or 3.12.**
# 2. `pip install langchain-openai langchain-core python-dotenv`
# 3. Get a free OpenRouter key at <https://openrouter.ai/keys>. The labs use the paid
#    `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` model, covered by the course credits.
# 4. Create a `.env` file next to this script: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...`
#
# This runs on a tiny built-in sample corpus, so you do not need to prepare your own
# dataset. It still requires an OpenRouter API key to run the LLM (it is not offline or
# free of API calls). The built-in corpus is deliberately minimal — it only demonstrates
# the security and cost concepts, not retrieval quality — and it is unrelated to your
# capstone: your design should target your own capstone corpus. Your full agent is what you
# describe in the written submission.
#
# **Model cost note.** The Module 6 labs explore a weak→strong model ladder
# (`qwen/qwen3-8b`, `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `openai/gpt-5.4-nano`, `qwen/qwen3.7-max`,
# `openai/gpt-5.4`) and a cost experiment
# (`google/gemma-4-31b-it:free`, `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, `openai/gpt-5.2-pro`).
# `openai/gpt-5.4` and `openai/gpt-5.2-pro` cost roughly 10× the others — treat them as
# opt-in and run them only on a tiny question set. This demo uses only `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`.

# 1. **System overview** — your scenario and the agent-based RAG system you built (2.1–5.1).
# 2. **Attack surfaces** — the channels an attacker can influence: the user turn (command/
#    roleplay injection), text inside retrieved documents (indirect injection), pasted
#    "sources", tool arguments, and conversation memory.
# 3. **Mitigations** — how you keep retrieved text as data (not instructions), separate
#    trusted from untrusted channels, constrain tools, and cap/log the loop — and how model
#    choice across the weak→strong ladder changes robustness.
# 4. **Cost optimizations** — how you reduce the number of tokens (fewer/reranked chunks,
#    tighter prompts, caching, a step cap) and use cheaper tokens (a smaller model, or a
#    mixed planner/answer split), grounded in the planner-vs-answer token measurement.
# 5. **Evaluation & reflection** — run your injection probes across the model ladder and a
#    small cost suite; report what held and what didn't, and the security/cost trade-offs.
#
# Include evidence (probe responses baseline vs. hardened, the token split from a log,
# per-model cost from a small question set).
