# # Capstone Checkpoint 5.1 — Designing and Evaluating an Agent-Based RAG System
# **MO-LLM Module 5 -  Required Capstone Checkpoint (120 minutes)**
#
# ## What this checkpoint is
#
# This is the final build step of your capstone. You will turn the retrieval system you've
# developed into an **agent-based RAG system**. Instead of a fixed pipeline, an agent
# decides at each step whether it has enough information, what to retrieve next, which
# tool to use, or whether to answer. This activity allows you to apply the Module 5 labs (Lab 5.1's agentic
# retriever and Lab 5.2's tool-using agent) to your capstone scenario.
#
# The graded deliverable is your completed Capstone Checkpoint 5.1 worksheet. This script is a
# runnable demonstration of an agentic loop on a tiny sample corpus so you can see the
# decision-making before adapting it to your full system.
#
# **Learning outcomes (Module 5):**
# 1. Build an agent-based system that integrates retrieval and external tools.
# 2. Use system prompts to guide agent behavior and decision-making.
# 3. Design workflows that coordinate retrieval, reasoning, and tool use in a RAG system.
# 4. Evaluate an agentic workflow against a fixed retrieval pipeline.
# 5. Design workflows that coordinate retrieval, reasoning, and tool use within a RAG system.
# 6. Build an agent-based system that integrates retrieval and external tools to complete user tasks.

# ## Step 1 — Keep your capstone scenario
#
# Use the **same scenario** you chose in Checkpoint 1.1 and have built on since.
#
# | Scenario | Corpus | Useful agent tools/actions |
# |---|---|---|
# | **Research Paper Navigator** | ~150 research-paper PDFs | semantic search; "find papers by author/year"; "follow citations"; ask a clarifying question |
# | **Wikipedia Retrieval Engine** | ~2,400 Wikipedia HTML articles | semantic search; "find by category"; "follow links"; ask a clarifying question |
#
# An agent shines when one query isn't enough — it can search, look at what it found,
# and decide to search again (or use a different tool) before answering.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setup (~5 min)
#
# 1. **Python 3.11 or 3.12**
# 2. `pip install langchain-openai langchain-core python-dotenv`
# 3. Get a free OpenRouter key at <https://openrouter.ai/keys>. The labs use the paid
#    `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` model, which is covered by the course credits.
# 4. Create a `.env` file next to this script: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...`
#
# This runs on a tiny built-in sample corpus, so you do not need to prepare your own
# dataset. It still requires an OpenRouter API key to run the LLM (it is not offline or
# free of API calls). The built-in corpus is deliberately minimal: It only demonstrates
# the agent control flow, not retrieval quality, and it is unrelated to your capstone:
# Howerver, your design should target your own capstone corpus. Your full agent is what you describe
# in the written submission.

# ## Step 4 — Your written submission (the graded deliverable)
#
# The deliverable is a **written submission** (suggested length: 500-750 words). Cover the following:
#
# 1. **System overview**: State your scenario and the retrieval system you built (2.1–4.1).
# 2. **Agent design**: Describe the actions/tools your agent can take, and how a **system prompt**
#    guides it to choose among them (retrieve, use a tool, clarify, or answer).
# 3. **Workflow**: Explain how retrieval, reasoning, and tool use are coordinated across steps,
#    and how the agent decides it has enough information to answer.
# 4. **Evaluation**: Compare the agent-based system against your fixed Checkpoint 2.1/3.1
#    pipeline on a few representative tasks. Did multi-step decision-making improve the
#    answers? At what cost (extra model calls, latency)?
# 5. **Reflection**: When an agentic approach adds value vs. when a simpler pipeline is
#    better, and the limitations/trade-offs of increasingly autonomous systems.
#
# Include evidence (sample tasks, the agent's step-by-step decisions from a log, before/
# after comparison).
