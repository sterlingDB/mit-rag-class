# # Capstone Checkpoint 4.1 — Advanced Retrieval Implementation
# **MO-LLM Module 4/Required Capstone Checkpoint (120 minutes)**
#
# ## What this checkpoint is
#
# This checkpoint advances your capstone system from a *single-pass* retriever to an
# **advanced retriever**. You will use the baseline retrieval system you built in
# Checkpoint 2.1 and evaluated in Checkpoint 3.1 to identify where single-pass retrieval
# falls short and apply the Module 4 techniques to fix it:
#
# - **Lab 4.1 — multistep retrieval (query decomposition):** Rewrite a complex
#   question into focused sub-queries, retrieve for each, and merge the results.
# - **Lab 4.2 — graph-based retrieval:** Organize your corpus as a graph of
#   relationships (citations, shared topics, links, same author/entity) and pull in
#   *related* documents a keyword/vector search would miss.
#
# You then **measure the improvement** against your 3.1 baseline. The graded
# deliverable is a **500-750 word written report** (final section). This script is a
# runnable demonstration of both techniques on a tiny sample corpus so you can see
# them work before adapting them to your real system.
#
# **Learning outcomes (Module 4):**
# 1. Identify common retrieval failures — e.g., complex multistep questions and too
#    much loosely-related context degrading the answer.
# 2. Explain *why* those failures occur with single-pass retrieval.
# 3. Implement an advanced retrieval strategy (query decomposition and/or graph
#    traversal) that addresses them.
# 4. Measure the improvement against your baseline using your 3.1 evaluation set.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Step 1 — Keep your capstone scenario
#
# Use the **same scenario** you chose in Checkpoint 1.1 and have built on since.
#
# | Scenario | Corpus | Natural relationships to exploit in a graph |
# |---|---|---|
# | **Research Paper Navigator** | ~150 research paper PDFs (`Labs/CapstoneDatasets/ResearchPapers/`) | citations, shared authors, shared topics/keywords, "published-before" |
# | **Wikipedia Retrieval Engine** | ~2,400 Wikipedia HTML articles (`Labs/CapstoneDatasets/Wikipedia/`) | hyperlinks between articles, shared categories, mentioned entities |
#
# Multistep decomposition shines on cross-document questions ("Compare X and Y,"
# "how did an idea evolve"); graph retrieval shines when the answer needs documents
# that are *related* to a hit but don't themselves match the query terms.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setup (~5 min)
#
# 1. **Python 3.11 or 3.12**
# 2. `pip install langchain-openai langchain-core python-dotenv networkx`
# 3. Use the OpenRouter API key provided for this course. This checkpoint uses
#   the `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` model, with usage covered by course credits.
# 4. Create a `.env` file next to this script: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...`
#
# This script runs on a tiny built-in sample corpus, so you do **not** need your full
# dataset indexed to complete it. You *will* refer to your real 2.1 system and 3.1
# evaluation results when you write the report.

# ## Step 6
#
# The checkpoint deliverable is your completed Capstone Checkpoint 4.1 worksheet, not
# code. Using evidence from your real system, cover:
#
# 1. **System overview** State your scenario and your 2.1 baseline retriever.
# 2. **Failure diagnosis** Describe the meaningful retrieval failure or limitation identified through
#    your Checkpoint 3.1 evaluation and explain why it occurs.
# 3. **Data redesign** Describe the node/edge schema you defined to expose relationships in
#    your corpus (citations/authors/topics, or links/categories/entities), and why you chose it. 
# 4. **Advanced retrieval implemented** Provide a query decomposition and/or graph traversal,
#    with code or log evidence. Label primary vs. context documents in the prompt.
# 5. **Comparative evaluation** Re-run your 3.1 evaluation on baseline vs advanced,
#    **comparing a similar number of retrieved documents**, and report before/after.
# 6. **Analysis & reflection** Discuss where it helped, where it hurt (redundant/over-broad
#    context), the cost/latency trade-off, and remaining limitations.
