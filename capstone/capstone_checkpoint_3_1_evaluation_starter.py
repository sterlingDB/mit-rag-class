# # Capstone Checkpoint 3.1 — Evaluation Infrastructure and Baseline Diagnosis
# **MO-LLM Module 3 / Required Capstone Checkpoint (120 minutes)**
#
# ## What this checkpoint is
#
# #
# This mirrors **Lab 3.1** (an LLM-judge that scores answers pass/fail against grading
# notes), applied to your capstone system. 
# You have a baseline retrieval system from Checkpoint 2.1. In this checkpoint, 
# you will use a structured evaluation approach to measure baseline performance, diagnose strengths 
# and weaknesses, and examine whether the evaluation framework detects problematic outputs.
# The starter script includes a small demonstration corpus and retriever to illustrate the 
# evaluation workflow. Apply the same evaluation approach to your selected capstone scenario and 
# baseline retrieval system. The graded deliverable is the completed Capstone Checkpoint 3.1 worksheet.
#
# **Learning outcomes (Module 3):**
# 1. Define evaluation metrics that reflect the real-world performance requirements of an LLM-powered retrieval system.
# 2. Identify key variables that influence system performance during evaluation and development.
# 3. Use language models to support evaluation tasks while avoiding common pitfalls.
# 4. Evaluate the performance of a retrieval-augmented system during development using a structured evaluation framework.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Step 1 — Keep your capstone scenario
#
# Use the **same scenario and baseline retriever** from Checkpoints 1.1 and 2.1.
#
# | Scenario | Corpus |
# |---|---|
# | **Research Paper Navigator** | ~150 research-paper PDFs (`Labs/CapstoneDatasets/ResearchPapers/`) |
# | **Wikipedia Retrieval Engine** | ~2,400 Wikipedia HTML articles (`Labs/CapstoneDatasets/Wikipedia/`) |

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setup (~5 min)
#
# 1. **Python 3.11 or 3.12.**
# 2. `pip install langchain-openai langchain-core python-dotenv`
# 3. Use the OpenRouter API key provided for this course.
# 4. Create a `.env` file next to this script: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...`
#
# Runs on a tiny built-in sample corpus, so you do not need to prepare your own dataset.
# It still requires an OpenRouter API key to run the LLM (it is not offline or free of API
# calls). You apply the same evaluation approach to your real system for the report.

# ## Step 6 — Your written responses in the Capstone Checkpoint 3.1 worksheet
#
# Complete the Capstone Checkpoint 3.1 worksheet using evidence from your capstone evaluation.
# Address the seven sections: system overview, evaluation design, testing approach, baseline results, 
# performance analysis, evaluation framework validation, and reflection and next steps.
#
# 1. **System overview** — your scenario and your 2.1 baseline retriever.
# 2. **Evaluation design** — your criteria and metric (what "correct" means; how the
#    judge decides pass/fail; any thresholds).
# 3. **Testing approach** — how you built your evaluation set and ran it.
# 4. **Baseline results** — the pass/fail outcomes and where the system falls short.
# 5. **Performance analysis** — what the results reveal about strengths, weaknesses,
#    and failure modes.
# 6. **Evaluation framework validation** — show your framework detects a degraded or
#    manipulated output (use the Step 5 result, or your own).
# 7. **Reflection and next steps** — limitations of your evaluation and what you'll
#    improve (this motivates the advanced retrieval in Checkpoint 4.1).
