# # Capstone Checkpoint 7.1: Production Readiness: Security and Performance Optimization
# **MO-LLM Module 7 /Required Capstone Checkpoint (120 minutes)**
#
# ## What this checkpoint is
#
# This is the production step of your capstone. In Module 6 you *diagnosed* two problems with
# your agent-based RAG system: It was **insecure** (prompt injection hijacked it) and
# **expensive** (its multistep loop used many tokens). Module 7 is where you *fix* them. You
# implement targeted safeguards that harden the agent and optimizations that cut its cost and
# latency. Then, you show **measurable gains** and explain what changed and why. This applies
# the Module 7 labs (Lab 7.1's safety middleware and Lab 7.2's cache + router) to your
# capstone scenario.
#
# The central lesson of Module 7: **There is no perfect fix.** Every safeguard adds a
# constraint, a cost, or complexity, and no single safeguard is sufficient. Effective systems
# stack multiple layers of defense. The same discipline that makes an agent safe (cap
# the loop, trim untrusted text) often makes it cheaper too.
#
# The graded deliverable is the completed Required Capstone Checkpoint 7.1 worksheet. 
# Use the worksheet to document your system overview, safeguards, performance optimizations, 
# evidence of improvement, trade-off analysis, and reflection. This script is a
# runnable demonstration — a tiny agent with an input sanitizer, a cache/router, and one
# injection probe — so you can see a real before/after in both security and cost before
# adapting it to your full system.
#
# **Learning outcomes (Module 7, LO 2–4):**
# 2. **Design and implement safeguards that improve the security and reliability of retrieval-augmented systems.
# 3. **Design strategies to optimize system performance and efficiency.
# 4. **Evaluate trade-offs among security, performance, cost, latency, and output quality when refining retrieval-augmented systems.


# %% [markdown]
# ## Step 1 — Keep your capstone scenario
#
# Use the **same scenario** you chose in Checkpoint 1.1 and have built on since. Module 7
# adds a production lens: strengthen the system's safeguards, then improve its efficiency.
#
# | Scenario | Corpus | Production concerns to fix |
# |---|---|---|
# | **Research Paper Navigator** | ~150 research-paper PDFs | sanitize the user turn (roleplay/command injection); XML-structure the context so a poisoned PDF page isn't read as instructions; cache repeated questions; route simple questions to a lower-cost single-call path |
# | **Wikipedia Retrieval Engine** | ~2,400 Wikipedia HTML articles | strip forged "sources" pasted into the query; keep retrieved article text as data; semantic-cache popular queries at scale; route one-hop questions away from the full agent loop |
#
# An agent does better when one query isn't enough. However, this same autonomy is what an attacker
# hijacks and what runs up the token bill. In production, you keep the autonomy while adding the guardrails and faster performance.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Setup (~5 min)
#
# 1. **Python 3.11 or 3.12**
# 2. `pip install langchain-openai langchain-core python-dotenv`
# 3. Use the OpenRouter API key provided for this program. The labs use the paid
#    `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` model, covered by the program credits.
# 4. Create a `.env` file next to this script: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...`
#
# This runs on a tiny built-in sample corpus, so you do not need to prepare your own
# dataset. It still requires an OpenRouter API key to run the LLM (it is not offline or
# free of API calls). The built-in corpus is deliberately minimal — it only demonstrates
# the security and cost mechanics, not retrieval quality — and it is unrelated to your
# capstone. Your design should target your own capstone corpus. Your full agent is what you
# describe in the written submission.
#
# **Model note:** The Module 7 labs use a small persona-filter model (`openai/gpt-5.4-nano`)
# and a lower-cost query router (`openai/gpt-5-nano`) alongside the default `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`,
# with `openai/gpt-5.4` as a fallback for hard queries. `openai/gpt-5.4` costs roughly 10×
# the others, so treat it as opt-in and reserve it for the answer step on hard questions. This
# demo only uses `openai/gpt-5.4-mini`. Its sanitizer, cache, and router are plain-Python
# stand-ins for the LLM-backed versions you build in Labs 7.1–7.2, kept minimal so the
# before/after is visible without extra dependencies.

#
# **Security (Lab 7.1):** `_sanitize_user_text` is the input middleware: it `_escape_xml`s the
# user turn (so the user cannot forge the trust boundary), strips injected e-mail blocks
# whole (headers and body), and neutralizes roleplay/ignore-instructions commands. The answer path wraps the
# context and the *sanitized* question in distinct XML tags and uses `HARDENED_XML_SYSTEM`, so
# only tagged `<documents>` are treated as source. (In the real lab the persona filter is a
# small LLM that fails open; here it is a deterministic regex so the before/after is visible.)
#
# **Cost/performance (Lab 7.2):** `SimpleCache` returns a stored answer for a repeated
# question (zero tokens, near-zero latency), and `route` sends simple one-hop questions to a
# cheap single-call `answer_direct` instead of the full `agentic_answer` loop.

# cache — a real before/after in tokens and latency. Then the security path: Replay one Lab
# 6.1 attack raw vs. sanitized through the hardened XML prompt so you can see the injection
# neutralized. Reproduce both in your real system across the model ladder for the report.

# ## Step 4 — Your completed Required Capstone Checkpoint 7.1 Worksheet
#
#
# 1. **System overview:** State your scenario and the agent-based RAG system you built (2.1–5.1),
#    along with the two Module 6 problems (insecure, expensive) you are now fixing.
# 2. **Safeguards:** Describe the security fixes you implemented and the specific Lab 6.1 failure
#    each one closes: input sanitization (roleplay/command injection), an XML-structured
#    trust boundary (fake-email/poisoned-document injection), a step cap + action log. Make
#    the tradeoff point explicit: Every safeguard adds a constraint/cost, and no single one is
#    sufficient; so, you layer them.
# 3. **Cost & performance optimizations:** Describe the semantic caching, query routing to a cheaper
#    single-call path, a smaller/mixed model, fewer/reranked chunks. This should be grounded in the
#    planner-vs.-answer token measurement from Lab 6.2 and the cache/router of Lab 7.2.
# 4. **Measurable gains:** Describe how many tokens are saved and how much latency is reduced on cache hits, 
#    direct-path cost vs. the full agent, and injection-probe pass rate before vs. after the 
#    safeguards. Run across the model ladder and a small cost suite.
# 5. **Residual risks & reflection:** What still isn't covered (e.g., staged multiturn attacks, a
#    stale cache on context-dependent questions, an over-eager sanitizer), and how would you monitor
#    for it? What security/cost trade-offs would you have to accept?
#
# Include evidence (e.g., probe responses raw vs. sanitized, the token/latency before/after from a
# log, per-model cost from a small question set).
